            <div id="profile"></div>
                 <p>As people grow towards becoming completely online, the amount of platforms to keep up with has become overwhelming.
                   Imagine the simplicity of having all the information you need, all in one place, and all on one card. With Passport you can
                   link your Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin, Etsy and anything else you need all to the same online business card, designed
                   to fit your personality or your business. Making things easier to network and keep track of. That’s what we hope to provide
                   to today’s busy professionals, students, and consumers; an all in one platform to share your information or to find it.</p>


            <ul>
            <h2>How does using Passport help the Enviroment? </h2>

                  <p> On average each year 8 million trees are cut down to print over 10 billion business cards and
                      88% of these cards are either thrown away, misplaced, or destroyed. By eliminating the traditional
                      business card and moving online we can do our part to curb global warming.</p>
